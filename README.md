# Caves of Zircon Tutorial

This project is part of the [How to Make a Roguelike](https://hexworks.org/posts/tutorials/2018/12/04/how-to-make-a-roguelike.html)
tutorial. Check out the article series if you want to make the most ouf of this project.


## Improvements

These are the future improvements we'll add to the tutorial based on feedback:

- [x] Explain `also` (and other scoping functions) in #4 (where it is first used) instead of #6
- [ ] Explain the point of `tryToFindAttribute` instead of using `findAttribute`: we don't need
  the flexibility and we're using mandatory attributes
